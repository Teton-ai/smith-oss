**Smith**, also known as Agent Smith, is Teton's Fleet Management System. It provides automation to easily deploy and monitor applications at scale.

## Architecture

Smith consists of three main components:

- **Smith API**: Backend service that manages deployment configurations and fleet status.
- **SmithD**: Daemon process that runs on each node in the fleet to execute deployments and report status back to the API.
- **Smith CLI (sm)** Command Line Interface to interact with the Smith API as a Fleet administrator.
